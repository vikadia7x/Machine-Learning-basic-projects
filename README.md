# Machine-Learning-basic-projects
The repo contains basic projects in Python using scikit-learn. The projects are-

1) Using cancer data from sklearn.datasets to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not. We will use Neural Network - Multi Layer Perceptron for classification.

2) Using data related to wine (The data belongs to UCI ML Repository) to predict the class of the wine clutivator. We will use Neural Network - Multi Layer Perceptron for classification. 

The above projects can serve you as your first applied machine learning projects. I have learned machine learning the same way.
